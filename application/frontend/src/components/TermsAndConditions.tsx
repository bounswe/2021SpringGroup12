        conditions of your use of the 3.144.201.198 website (“Website”),
        “3.144.201.198” mobile application (“Mobile Application”) and any of
        their related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This
        Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and
        this Website operator and Mobile Application developer (“Operator”,
        “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf
        of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
        authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms
        “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have
        such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement,
        you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the
        Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you
        have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
        Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you
        and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
        signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services. This terms and
        conditions policy was created with the help of the terms and conditions

        You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Services. By using the
        Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent
        that you are at least 13 years of age. If you create an account on the
        Services, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your
        account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur
        under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We
        may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before
        you may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact
        information of any kind may result in the termination of your account.
        You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account
        or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or
        omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result
        of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your
        account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
        provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend
        to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the
        foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may
        block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent
        further registration.

      <Paragraph>
        We do not own any data, information or material (collectively,
        “Content”) that you submit on the Services in the course of using the
        Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
        integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual
        property ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but
        have no obligation to, monitor and review the Content on the Services
        submitted or created using our Services by you. You grant us permission
        to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and
        perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the
        purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those
        representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the
        obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content
        that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in
        any way harmful or objectionable. Unless specifically permitted by you,
        your use of the Services does not grant us the license to use,
        reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by
        you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any
        similar purpose.

        sole responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of your Content.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain
        circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able to restore
        some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and
        time when we may have backed up data for our own purposes. We make no
        guarantee that the data you need will be available.

      <Paragraph>
        Although the Services may link to other resources (such as websites,
        mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying
        any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with
        any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not
        responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the
        offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their
        resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the
        actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You
        should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use
        of any resource which you access through a link on the Services. Your

        now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does not

        parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property
        will remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator. All
        trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with
        the Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or
        its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used
        in connection with the Services may be the trademarks of other third
        parties. Your use of the Services grants you no right or license to
        reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or third party
        trademarks.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Limitation of liability</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the
        Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
        suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,

        sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business
        interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
        however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
        limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty,
        negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to
        the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
        the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
        of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
        suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an
        amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash
        by you to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first
        event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and
        exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for

        and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not
        violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
        necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid
        or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this
        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that
        the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their

        effect.

        choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Turkey. The
