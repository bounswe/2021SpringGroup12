      <Title> Privacy policy </Title>

      <Paragraph>
        We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our
        compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes
        the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide
        (“Personal Information”) on the 3.144.201.198 website (“Website”),
        “3.144.201.198” mobile application (“Mobile Application”), and any of
        their related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our
        practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing
        that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to
        you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
        access and update it.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or
        “your”) and this Website operator and Mobile Application developer
        (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this
        agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
        that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in
        which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity.
        If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms
        of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access
        and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you
        acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the
        terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
        companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do
        not employ or manage.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Collection of personal information</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or
        revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a
        specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of
        the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to provide
        certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail
        address).
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
        you create an account, publish content, or fill any forms on the
        Services. When required, this information may include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain features on the mobile device (such as contacts, calendar,
            gallery, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles,
            images, feedback, etc)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
        then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on
        the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
        mandatory are welcome to contact us.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Privacy of children</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under
        the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any
        Personal Information through the Services. If you have reason to believe
        that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us
        through the Services, please contact us to request that we delete that
        child’s Personal Information from our Services.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
        Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
        children never to provide Personal Information through the Services
        without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal
        guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions
        to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal
        Information when online without their permission.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Use and processing of collected information</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal
        Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement
        with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be
        the data processor.<Paragraph></Paragraph>
        Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving
        Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when
        we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
        ensure your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a
        data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the
        processing of Personal Information.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit
        Personal Information through the Services. We do not own, control, or
        make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such
        Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your
        instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information
        acts as a data controller.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal
        obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information.
        If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be
        able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the
        information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
          <li>Send administrative information</li>
          <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
          <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
          <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
          <li>Run and operate the Services</li>
        </ul>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
        the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the
        following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
        specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the
        performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
        obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a
        legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to
        a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
        official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the
        purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
        information until you object to such processing by opting out, without
        having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case,
        we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
        processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
        Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
        necessary to enter into a contract.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Managing information</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.
        The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services
        change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a
        copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the
        duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and
        partners, and for the purposes described below.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Disclosure of information</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        To maintain the highest level of privacy and to protect your Personal
        Information to the full extent, we do not share your Personal
        Information with anyone and for any reason.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Retention of information</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
        necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our
        agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is
        required or permitted by law.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
        Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner
        that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
        Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
        the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data
        portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
        period.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Cookies</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        Our Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A
        cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page
        server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
        your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
        read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. If you
        choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to use and experience
        the features of the Services. Click here to learn more about cookies and
        how they work.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for security
        and personalization, to operate the Services, and for statistical
        purposes. Please note that you have the ability to accept or decline
        cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but
        you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Do Not Track signals</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
        websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
        tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
        connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
        collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or
        visit a website or online service as they move across different websites
        over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
        uniform. As a result, the Services are not yet set up to interpret or
        respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so,
        as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and
        collection of your Personal Information.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Links to other resources</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or
        controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
        privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage
        you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy
        statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal
        Information.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Information security</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        No data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
        guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal
        Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy
        limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the
        security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
        exchanged between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii)
        any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit
        by a third party, despite best efforts.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security
        of the device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to
        protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures to protect
        this information.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Data breach</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been
        compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to
        unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but
        not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
        reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to,
        investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation
        with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will
        make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe
        that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the
        breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will
        send you an email.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Changes and amendments</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the
        Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the
        updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to
        you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact
        information you have provided.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the
        posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued
        use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or
        such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to
        those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your
        Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was
        stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title level={3}>Acceptance of this policy</Title>

      <Paragraph>
        You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its
        terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Services and submitting
